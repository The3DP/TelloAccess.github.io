## 🛠️ Operating Tips for DJI Tello

Flying the DJI Tello drone can be a rewarding experience for both beginners and seasoned pilots. Here are some key tips to help you operate your drone effectively:

### 🔋 Pre-Flight Preparation

- **Check the Battery:** The Tello drone typically lasts 10–15 minutes per charge. Always ensure it’s fully charged before takeoff.
- **Inspect the Drone:** Look for any damaged propellers or loose components.
- **Clear Flight Area:** Choose an open space free of trees, wires, and wind.

### 📶 Connectivity

- **Wi-Fi Connection:** Connect your device to the Tello Wi-Fi network before flying.
- **Signal Strength:** Stay within the drone’s 100-meter range for reliable connection.

### 🚀 Basic Flight Controls

- **Takeoff & Landing:** Use the app’s takeoff/landing button or manual controls for stable operation.
- **Directional Controls:**
  - **Up/Down:** Vertical movement
  - **Forward/Backward:** Move horizontally in your facing direction
  - **Left/Right:** Lateral movement
  - **Yaw (Rotation):** Rotate left or right using the left joystick

### 🧭 Flight Best Practices

- **Start Slow:** Practice low, slow flights if you're a beginner.
- **Use Beginner Mode:** Limits speed and altitude for safer control.
- **Practice Patterns:** Fly in circles or squares to build coordination.
- **Hovering:** Practice keeping the drone stable at different altitudes.

### 🎥 Camera Tips

- **720p Camera:** Capture photos and videos through the Tello app.
- **Stable Shots:** Move slowly to avoid jittery footage.
- **Creative Angles:** Experiment with flight paths for dynamic visuals.

### ⚠️ Safety & Maintenance

- **Monitor Battery Life:** Land early when under 20% battery.
- **Use Spare Batteries:** Great for extended sessions.
- **Fly in Sight:** Always keep visual contact with the drone.
- **Avoid Obstacles:** Tello has limited obstacle detection.
- **Store Properly:** Keep in a dry, safe space. Avoid damaging propellers.
- **Clean Regularly:** Wipe sensors and blades with a soft cloth.

### 🧠 Troubleshooting

- **Lost Signal:** Tello will hover or return to the last known position.
- **Calibration Issues:** Recalibrate via the app if flight becomes unstable.
- **App Crashes:** Restart your device or reinstall the app if needed.

### 💻 Advanced Features

- **Tello SDK:** Use Python or other languages to program flight paths.
- **Gesture Control:** Some apps allow simple gestures for control and photography.
